# Gesture Recognition System ✋

This project utilizes computer vision techniques to recognize hand gestures from video streams or images.

## Overview ℹ️

Gesture recognition allows for intuitive interaction with devices and systems. This project employs computer vision and machine learning to interpret hand gestures, enabling gesture-based control in various applications.

## Features 🚀

- **Mediapipe Integration**: Utilizes the Mediapipe library for hand pose estimation.
- **Gesture Classification**: Trains models to classify hand gestures based on pose features.
- **Real-time Processing**: Capable of processing live video streams for instant gesture recognition.
- **User-defined Gestures**: Supports recognition of custom-defined gestures for specific applications.
